# unit-4-game

The Crystal Colector game is an exercise with Jquery. We have learned how to create a page with HTML and style it with CSS and Bootsrap but in order to make it dynamic we use Jquery and Javascript. 

This project is useful because it refreshes the programmer in HTML/CSS but implements the new material from unit 4 to make it interactive, i.e clicking a button to add to your score. 

Users can get started on this project by psuedo-coding what the user is supposed to do to win. example: 
        When user clicks on crystal a random number is generated and added to their score.
        When different crystals are clicked their values are summed together.
        When the user's "points so far" exceeds the "number to match" the game is over, losses increase.
        etc.
